## Project description

My PhD research, that forms part of the ERC-funded Emerging pests and pathogens as a novel lens for unravelling social-ecological cascades (INFLUX) project, focuses on exploring the downstream phase of an emerging pest/pathogen (EPP) cascade. In my work, I aim to assess the cascading impacts of emerging microbial pathogens, arthropod and plant pests within the bounds of being relevant to human health and production ecosystems.
